# Monkeys_and_the_Canyon
Monkeys can cross hand-over-hand via the rope from one side of the canyon to the other with these rules:
=> Many monkeys can cross at the same time if they are all going in the same direction. From west to east or all from east to west.
=> If eastward moving and westward moving monkeys ever get onto the rope at the same time, they will meet and get stuck in the middle (a deadlock will occur) because each monkey cannot climb over another. 
=> Before crossing the canyon, monkeys must check to see that no other monkey is currently crossing in the opposite direction.
=> Starvation must also be avoided. Ex: when a monkey wants to cross to the east arrives at the rope and finds monkeys crossing to the west, the monkey waits until the rope is empty, but no more westward moving monkeys are allowed to start until at least one monkey has crossed the other way.
